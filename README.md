 Word guessing game
 
 OVERVIEW:

This code chooses a random phrase from a list of five phrases and displays each letter of the phrase as underscore (_) character placeholders.

After the player is prompted to guess a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the phrase object is updated so that it displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess all the letters of the phrase (and win), or makes five incorrect guesses (and lose). Finally, the player is given the option to play again.
